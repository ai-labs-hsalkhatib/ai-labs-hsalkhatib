## ℹ️ About

I design and deliver practical machine-learning and AI systems end-to-end—from data pipelines and modeling to evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. 
My work emphasizes **statistical rigor**, **interpretability**, and **reproducibility**.
I also conduct applied AI research in **healthcare** and **workforce/people analytics**, translating findings into reliable, production-ready solutions.

## 🏗️ Featured Projects (in progress)

### Workforce Demand & Cost Forecasting
Multivariate time series forecasting with hierarchical rollups; backtesting, confidence intervals, and scenario analysis.

### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA)
Graph construction from survey/communication data; centrality, communities, cross-region flows; interactive visualizations.

### Patient Journey Modeling
Sequence labeling and temporal similarity for clinical pathways; evaluation against guideline-aligned outcomes.

### Healthcare Knowledge Graphs & Similarity
Ontology-driven KG, entity/relation extraction, graph embeddings, and patient similarity for cohort discovery.

> As projects finalize, this section will link directly to subfolders with full documentation and results.

## 🎯 Technical Focus

- **Modeling:** classical ML, time series (ETS/ARIMA/Prophet), gradient boosting, sequence models, graph analytics  
- **Causality & Evaluation:** A/B design, uplift, causal diagrams, sensitivity analysis, robust validation  
- **Graphs & KGs:** Neo4j/NetworkX, entity/relation extraction, similarity search, path analytics  
- **MLOps & Reproducibility:** environment pinning, data versioning, experiment tracking, CI-friendly structure  
- **Explainability & Ethics:** interpretable models, documentation of assumptions, bias/impact assessments

## 🔍 How to Explore

1. Browse the `projects/` directory and open a project’s `README.md` for scope and results.  
2. Create the environment specified by `environment.yml` or `pyproject.toml`.  
3. Run notebooks in order (prefixed numerically) or use `src/` entry points as documented.  
4. Check `reports/` for figures, metrics, and executive summaries.

> **Note:** Real production data is not included. Where appropriate, synthetic data or loaders are provided.

---

## 📋 Reproducibility & Standards

- **Environments:** pinned dependencies via `conda` (`environment.yml`) or `uv/poetry` (`pyproject.toml`).  
- **Structure:** consistent, modular Python package layout per project.  
- **Testing:** lightweight unit tests for core utilities where applicable.  
- **Docs:** each project documents assumptions, metrics, and limitations.  
- **Licensing/Data:** code is open under the repository license; datasets respect original terms or are synthetic.

---

## ✍🏻 Research & Writing

Selected work may be distilled into:
- Method notes and implementation guides in `docs/`  
- Short tutorials and case studies within project `README.md`  
- Drafts of articles or slide decks summarizing findings and impact
