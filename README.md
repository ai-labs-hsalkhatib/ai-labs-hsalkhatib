## About

I build practical AI systems for two domains:
1. **Workforce/People Analytics:** forecasting demand/supply and cost, retention risk, organizational network analysis, and decision support.
2. **Healthcare AI:** patient-journey modeling, knowledge graphs, similarity search, and outcomes analytics.

My work emphasizes statistical rigor, interpretability, and reproducibility.
